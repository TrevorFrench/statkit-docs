## Overview

Uploading data is the first step in any statistical analysis. StatKit makes it easy to upload your data files and get started with analysis quickly.

## Supported File Formats

### CSV Files (Recommended)
- **Comma-separated values**: Most common format
- **UTF-8 encoding**: Supports international characters
- **Header row**: Column names in the first row
- **File size**: Currently no limits (subject to change)

**Related**: [Data Exploration](data-exploration.qmd)

### Other Formats
- **Excel files** (.xlsx, .xls): Convert to CSV for best results
- **Text files** (.txt): Tab or comma separated
- **JSON files**: Structured data format

## Step-by-Step Upload Process

### 1. Prepare Your Data
Before uploading, ensure your data is ready:
- **Clean your data**: Remove errors and inconsistencies
- **Check formatting**: Ensure proper column headers
- **Verify data types**: Numeric columns should contain numbers
- **Handle missing values**: Decide how to treat missing data

**Related**: [Data Exploration](data-exploration.qmd)

### 2. Access the Upload Feature
- **Sign in** to your StatKit account
- **Navigate** to the dashboard
- **Click** "Upload Dataset" button
- **Select** your file from your device

### 3. File Selection
- **Browse** your computer for the file
- **Select** the file you want to upload
- **Verify** the file name and size
- **Click** "Upload" to proceed

### 4. Data Preview
After upload, StatKit will:
- **Display** a preview of your data
- **Show** column names and data types
- **Identify** potential issues
- **Allow** you to review before proceeding

## Data Requirements

### Column Types
- **Numeric columns**: For statistical calculations
- **Categorical columns**: For grouping and comparison
- **Text columns**: For labels and descriptions
- **Date columns**: For time-series analysis

### Data Quality
- **No empty headers**: All columns should have names
- **Consistent formatting**: Same data type within columns
- **Reasonable values**: Check for obvious errors
- **Appropriate sample size**: Enough data for meaningful analysis

## Common Upload Issues

### File Too Large
- **Issue**: File too large for processing
- **Solution**: Consider sampling or reducing file size if needed

### Encoding Problems
- **Issue**: Special characters appear incorrectly
- **Solution**: Save file with UTF-8 encoding

### Missing Headers
- **Issue**: Column names are missing or unclear
- **Solution**: Add descriptive column names in the first row

### Mixed Data Types
- **Issue**: Numeric columns contain text
- **Solution**: Clean data before upload, separate numeric and text columns

## Best Practices

### Before Upload
- **Backup your data**: Keep original files safe
- **Document your data**: Note what each column represents
- **Check for errors**: Look for obvious mistakes
- **Consider privacy**: Remove sensitive information if needed

### During Upload
- **Use descriptive names**: Make column names clear and meaningful
- **Check preview**: Verify data looks correct
- **Note any warnings**: Address issues before analysis
- **Save metadata**: Keep track of data sources and dates

### After Upload
- **Run data quality checks**: Use StatKit's built-in tools
- **Explore your data**: Start with descriptive statistics
- **Plan your analysis**: Decide which tests to run
- **Document your process**: Keep notes for reproducibility

## Data Management

### Organizing Files
- **Use clear names**: Descriptive file names
- **Group related data**: Keep similar datasets together
- **Version control**: Keep track of different versions
- **Backup regularly**: Don't rely on cloud storage alone

### Updating Data
- **Replace old files**: Upload new versions when data changes
- **Note changes**: Document what was updated
- **Check compatibility**: Ensure new data works with existing analyses
- **Archive old versions**: Keep previous versions for reference
