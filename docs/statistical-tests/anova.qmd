# ANOVA

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) compares means across three or more groups to determine if there are significant differences.

## When to Use

- **Multiple groups**: Compare means across 3+ groups
- **Categorical predictor**: One categorical variable defining groups
- **Continuous outcome**: Numeric variable to compare

**Example**: Compare test scores across students in different schools.

## Data Requirements

- **Outcome Variable**: Continuous numeric variable
- **Group Variable**: Categorical variable with 3+ groups
- **Sample Size**: At least 2 observations per group
- **Independence**: Observations are independent

## How to Run

1. Select "ANOVA" from the test dropdown
2. Choose your CSV file
3. Select your outcome variable
4. Select your group variable
5. Click "Run Test"

## Interpreting Results

### Key Statistics

- **F-statistic**: Ratio of between-group to within-group variance
- **p-value**: Probability of observing these differences by chance
- **Degrees of Freedom**: Between and within groups
- **Group Means**: Average values for each group

### Statistical Significance

- **p < 0.05**: At least one group differs significantly
- **p < 0.01**: Strong evidence of differences
- **p < 0.001**: Very strong evidence of differences

### Effect Size

- **Eta-squared**: Proportion of variance explained by groups
- **Large effect**: η² > 0.14
- **Medium effect**: η² = 0.06 - 0.14
- **Small effect**: η² < 0.06

## Assumptions

- **Normality**: Data approximately follows normal distribution
- **Independence**: Observations are independent
- **Equal Variance**: Groups have similar variability
- **Random Sampling**: Data collected randomly

## Export Options

- **LaTeX**: Copy-paste ready tables
- **CSV**: Structured data files
