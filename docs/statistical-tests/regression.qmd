# Regression

Regression models predict outcomes based on input variables. StatKit supports linear and logistic regression.

## Types of Regression

### Linear Regression
Predict continuous outcomes.

**Example**: Predict house prices based on size, location, age.

### Logistic Regression
Predict binary outcomes.

**Example**: Predict whether a customer will buy (yes/no) based on demographics.

## Data Requirements

### Linear Regression

- **Dependent Variable**: Continuous numeric outcome
- **Independent Variables**: One or more numeric predictors
- **Sample Size**: At least n+1 observations (where n = number of predictors)

### Logistic Regression

- **Dependent Variable**: Binary or categorical with exactly 2 values
- **Independent Variables**: One or more numeric or categorical predictors
- **Sample Size**: At least n+1 observations per category

## How to Run

1. Select "Regression" from the test dropdown
2. Choose your CSV file
3. Select your dependent variable
4. Choose independent variables
5. Click "Run Test"

## Interpreting Results

### Linear Regression

- **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained (0 to 1)
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error - prediction accuracy
- **Coefficients**: Change in outcome per unit change in predictor
- **P-values**: Statistical significance of predictors

### Logistic Regression

- **Pseudo R-squared**: Measure of model fit
- **Coefficients**: Change in log-odds per unit change in predictor
- **P-values**: Statistical significance of predictors

### Model Fit

- **Linear**: Higher R-squared indicates better fit
- **Logistic**: Higher pseudo R-squared indicates better fit
- **P-values**: < 0.05 indicates significant predictors

## Assumptions

### Linear Regression

- **Linearity**: Relationship between variables is linear
- **Independence**: Observations are independent
- **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals
- **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed

### Logistic Regression

- **Independence**: Observations are independent
- **No multicollinearity**: Predictors are not highly correlated
- **Large sample size**: At least 10 events per predictor

## Export Options

- **LaTeX**: Copy-paste ready tables
- **CSV**: Structured data files
