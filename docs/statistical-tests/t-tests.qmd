# T-Tests

T-tests compare means between groups to determine if differences are statistically significant.

## Types of T-Tests

### Independent Samples T-Test
Compare means between two separate groups.

**Example**: Compare test scores between students in different schools.

**Data Requirements**:

- **Data Column**: Numeric variable to compare
- **Group Column**: Categorical variable with exactly 2 groups
- **Sample Size**: At least 2 observations per group

### Paired Samples T-Test
Compare means of related observations.

**Example**: Before/after treatment measurements.

**Data Requirements**:

- **Column 1**: First set of measurements
- **Column 2**: Second set of measurements (paired)
- **Sample Size**: At least 2 pairs

### One-Sample T-Test
Test if a single group differs from a hypothesized value.

**Example**: Test if a class average differs from the national average.

**Data Requirements**:

- **Column**: Numeric variable
- **Population Mean**: Hypothesized value (default: 0)
- **Sample Size**: At least 2 observations

## How to Run

1. Select "T-Test" from the test dropdown
2. Choose the test type (Independent, Paired, One-sample)
3. Select your data columns
4. Click "Run Test"

## Interpreting Results

### Key Statistics

- **t-statistic**: Measure of difference relative to variability
- **p-value**: Probability of observing this difference by chance
- **Degrees of Freedom**: Number of independent observations
- **Group Means**: Average values for each group

### Statistical Significance

- **p < 0.05**: Generally significant
- **p < 0.01**: Strong significance
- **p < 0.001**: Very strong significance

## Assumptions

- **Normality**: Data approximately follows normal distribution
- **Independence**: Observations are independent (except paired tests)
- **Equal Variance**: Groups have similar variability (independent tests)

## Export Options

- **LaTeX**: Copy-paste ready tables
- **CSV**: Structured data files
