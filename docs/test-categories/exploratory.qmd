## Overview

Exploratory analysis is the first step in any statistical investigation. It helps you understand your data's structure, identify patterns, and detect potential issues before running formal statistical tests.

## What is Exploratory Analysis?

Exploratory analysis involves:
- **Data summarization**: Understanding central tendencies and variability
- **Pattern identification**: Finding trends, outliers, and relationships
- **Data quality assessment**: Checking for missing values, errors, and inconsistencies
- **Distribution analysis**: Understanding how your data is distributed

## Available Tools in StatKit

### Descriptive Statistics
The foundation of exploratory analysis. Use this to:
- Calculate means, medians, standard deviations
- Identify minimum and maximum values
- Understand data distributions
- Check for outliers

**Related**: [Descriptive Statistics](../statistical-tests/descriptive-statistics.qmd)

### Data Quality Checks
Before running any analysis, ensure your data is clean:
- Check for missing values
- Identify data types
- Verify data ranges
- Look for inconsistencies

**Related**: [Data Exploration](../data-management/data-exploration.qmd)

## When to Use Exploratory Analysis

### Always Start Here
- **New datasets**: Understand what you're working with
- **Data cleaning**: Identify issues before analysis
- **Hypothesis generation**: Discover patterns that suggest further testing
- **Quality control**: Ensure data meets assumptions

### Specific Use Cases
- **Academic research**: Preliminary data exploration
- **Business analytics**: Understanding customer behavior patterns
- **Student projects**: Learning data analysis fundamentals
- **Data exploration**: Discovering insights in large datasets

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Upload Your Data
Start by uploading your CSV file to StatKit.

**Related**: [Uploading Data](../data-management/uploading-data.qmd)

### 2. Run Descriptive Statistics
Select multiple variables to get a comprehensive overview:
- **Numeric variables**: Means, medians, standard deviations
- **Categorical variables**: Frequency counts
- **Multiple variables**: Compare distributions across groups

### 3. Interpret Results
Look for:
- **Central tendency**: Where most values cluster
- **Variability**: How spread out the data is
- **Skewness**: Whether data is symmetric or skewed
- **Outliers**: Unusual values that might need attention

### 4. Plan Next Steps
Based on your findings:
- **Clean data** if needed
- **Choose appropriate tests** for your research questions
- **Consider transformations** for skewed data
- **Design follow-up analyses**

## Best Practices

### Data Visualization
- Always visualize your data when possible
- Look for patterns, trends, and outliers
- Consider different chart types for different data types

### Multiple Perspectives
- Examine data from different angles
- Consider different groupings and subsets
- Look for relationships between variables

### Documentation
- Keep notes on your findings
- Document any data cleaning steps
- Record insights for future reference

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Data
- **Issue**: Incomplete datasets
- **Solution**: Use StatKit's data quality checks to identify missing values

### Outliers
- **Issue**: Extreme values affecting analysis
- **Solution**: Examine outliers carefully - they might be errors or important findings

### Non-normal Distributions
- **Issue**: Data doesn't follow normal distribution
- **Solution**: Consider data transformations or non-parametric tests

## Next Steps

After completing exploratory analysis:
1. **Clean your data** if issues were found
2. **Choose appropriate statistical tests** based on your findings
3. **Run formal analyses** to test your hypotheses
4. **Document your process** for reproducibility
